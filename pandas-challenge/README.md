# PyCity Schools Analysis

- Our analysis shows us that in a region of 15 schools we have just under 40,000 students. Almost three quarters of all students are passing math and nearly 86% are passing reading, but only 65% are overall passing. This leads us to conclude while reading and math scores are relatively good we must focus on other subjects as well. From our top and bottom schools data we see that the charter schools do considerably better than the district schools. We see that while the average grades themselves are relatively close, (between 3-6 points), the percentages that are passing between the charter and district schools are drastically different with the top charter school having an overall passing rate of 91.33% and the lowest district school being 52.98%. Interestingly we see that as school spending per student increases the overall passing percentage actually goes down, leading us to question if that money is being spent effectively or if it can be repurposed to better suit the students' needs. From our school sizes data we note large schools have a much lower passing rate compared to medium or small. We're not sure if this is due to class sizes, since smaller schools by student count would not necessarily have smaller class sizes, but perhaps we could try to find out. Our final data sorted by charter and district type schools further reinforces that the charter schools have a dramatically better overall passing rate
